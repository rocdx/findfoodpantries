Through donated food, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) commodities and purchased food, and the generous support of individuals we are able to support nonprofit agencies in Orange County serving low-income families and individuals. In a typical year, the food bank distributes more than 23 million pounds of food. In June 2020, we have increased the pounds of food distributed by 59% compared to this time last year. The OC Food Bank partnered with Power of One Foundation to set up weekly mass drive-thru distributions. In August 2020 we acknowledged serving 1 million people affected by the economic downturn caused by COVID-19 and we anticipate the need will continue to grow.",
